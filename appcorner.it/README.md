Show your favorite apps in your website
============

You can use AppCorner for iPhone to show your posted apps with your comments on your website using appcorner.it as service for free.

Post at least one app in Appcorner for iPhone, retrive your facebook id (you could add a breakpoint in  PFLogInViewController.m for facebookId variable).

Paste your facebook id in `userapps.js` and change the itunes iso country code as you prefer:
`http://www.appcorner.it/userapps?fb=[YOUR FACEBOOK ID]&country=[ITUNES COUNTRY CODE]&limit=[APPS LIMIT, MAX 12 BY DEFAULT]&phgat=[YOUR PHG AFFILIATE TOKEN]&skip=[NUMBER OF APPS TO SKIP]`

Try userapps.html, that's it!

**You can create a website with price drops as appcorner.it in minutes**

The API will be published soon!


The free service on appcorner.it is WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND UPTIME AVAILABILITY.

[Let me know](http://www.appcorner.it/en/contacts.html) if you use this service on your site, so I can notify you when appcorner.it is down for maintenance.

enjoy!
