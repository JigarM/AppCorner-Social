Show your favorite apps in your website
============

**You can use AppCorner for iPhone to show your posted apps with your comments on your website an make money with your iTunes affiliate token**

Post at least one app in AppCorner for iPhone, retrive your facebook id (you could add a breakpoint in  PFLogInViewController.m for facebookId variable).

Paste your facebook id in `appcornerapps.js`, open userapps.html, that's it!

**You can create a website with price drops as appcorner.it in minutes an make money with your iTunes affiliate token**

Paste your facebook id in `appcornerapps.js`, open pricedrops.html, that's it!

I encourage anyone who wants to build your own widgets to show the apps as open source, who know php could create a plugin for wordpress.

The free service on appcorner.it is **WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND UPTIME AVAILABILITY**, one facebook id only can be used for a single domain, please do not abuse otherwise the service it will turned off.
If you use this service leave the logo of appcorner.it (with the link) on your page.

The service is in beta, it requires to compile and login in AppCorner for iPhone, and recovery the facebook id to copy in appcornerapps.js, in the future everything will be easier, for now it remains a service for developers only.

[Let me know](http://www.appcorner.it/en/contacts.html) if you use this service on your site, so I can notify you when appcorner.it is down for maintenance.

enjoy!
