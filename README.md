This app use Deployd as backend on appcorner.it and use DeploydKit library.

The server side code will be relased soon.

The story:
- I developed DeploydKit
- I saw AnyPic of parse.com
- I have developed a layer to replace Parse framework (External/ParseKit)
- I developed the code of the server quickly
- AnyPic works!
- I moved the photo entity as App entity and other customizations
- AppCorner social works!
- The app not pass the approval rule 2.25 of App Store
- I forgot the app for some time
- I developed AppCornerKit as new project
- Now the app is open source

Have fun without tear down the server!
