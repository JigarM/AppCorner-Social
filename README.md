This app use [Deployd](http://deployd.com) as server on [appcorner.it](http://www.appcorner.it) and  [DeploydKit](https://github.com/appcornerit/DeploydKit) library.

The server side code will be relased soon.

The story:
- I developed [DeploydKit](https://github.com/appcornerit/DeploydKit)
- I saw [Anypic](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Anypic) of parse.com
- I have developed a layer called [ParseKit] (https://github.com/appcornerit/AppCorner-Social/tree/master/External/ParseKit) to replace Parse framework on top of DeploydKit
- I developed the code of the server quickly
- Anypic works!
- I moved the photo entity as app entity (and other customizations)
- AppCorner social works!
- The app not pass the approval rule 2.25 of App Store
- I forgot the app for some time
- I developed AppCornerKit and [iTunesPicker](https://github.com/appcornerit/iTunesPicker) as new project starting from pieces of AppCorner Social
- Now the app is open source

Have fun without tear down the server!
