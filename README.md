This app for iOS (iPhone only) use [Deployd](http://deployd.com) as server on [appcorner.it](http://www.appcorner.it) and  [DeploydKit](https://github.com/appcornerit/DeploydKit) library.

The story:
- I developed [DeploydKit](https://github.com/appcornerit/DeploydKit)
- I saw [Anypic](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Anypic) a full featured photo sharing app built on [Parse.com](https://parse.com)
- I developed a layer called [ParseKit] (https://github.com/appcornerit/AppCorner-Social/tree/master/External/ParseKit) to replace Parse framework on top of DeploydKit
- I developed the code of the server quickly
- Anypic works with Deployd!
- I moved the photo entity as app entity (and other customizations) and so the new name is AppCorner
- AppCorner works with Deployd!
- The app not pass the [approval rule](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) 2.25 of App Store
- I forgot the app for some time
- I developed AppCornerKit and [iTunesPicker](https://github.com/appcornerit/iTunesPicker) as new project starting from pieces of AppCorner
- Now the app is open source

The app on appcorner.it could be used to share your apps, get opinions, suggestions, ideas or find collaborations of other iOS developers.

Refer to [README](https://github.com/appcornerit/AppCorner-Social/tree/master/Deployd-Modules) to try the app with your server.

I encourage anyone who wants to contribute, you can build your social app that share musics, books or TV series (from iTunes) with a few of changes. Build your server is quite simple so have fun without tear down the appcorner.it server.
